### Notes
* Project owner: Jason Maloney, Bing-Je Wu,  Maya Mileva and Antonio Llorens
* This project is inspired by [Kevin Markham from Data School](https://www.dataschool.io/about/)
* Build an adaptive version of the application based on the concept of [this application](https://justmarkham.shinyapps.io/textprediction/)
* The goal for this application is to predict the sentiment level (positive or negative) of a movie review in real-time with the ability to recommend the next word that a user is going to enter.

### How To Build
* [The movie review dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) is going to be used to build models for prediction.

* Use [Anvil](https://anvil.works/) to build the application.
